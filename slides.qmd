-   Independent software developer and consultant ([Big Creek Software, LLC](https://www.bigcreek.com/){.external target="_blank"})

-   Currently working primarily on a machine learning project with video data

-   Casual user of Census data -- Not an expert!

-   Agreed to give this talk to give myself an incentive to finish reading Kyle Walker's book.

## Outline

Today we will cover

-   How US Census data is organized
-   Obtaining the data you want
-   Wrangling the data
-   Visualizing the data
    -   Plots
    -   Choropleth maps

Hard copy available for pre-order from CRC Press.

## Census API key

To use `tidycensus`, you will need a Census API key, which you can get for free from [http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html){.external target="_blank"}.

<hr/>

Run the following once to install your key in your `.Renviron` file so it will automatically be available for future sessions.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(tidycensus)
census_api_key("YOUR KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
```

## How is US Census data organized?

US Census data is organized by

-   Datasets
-   Variables
-   Geographies

. . .

Today we will use just two datasets, but many more are available.

-   2020 Decennial Census
-   2016-2020 American Community Survey

## Decennial Census

The 2020 Decennial Census is supposed to be an *enumeration* of the whole US population. It collects a limited number of variables on race, ethnicity, age, sex, and housing tenure.

::: callout-note
The limited data currently available was released under [P.L. 94-171](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html){.external target="_blank"} for political redistricting purposes.
:::

## American Community Survey

-   ACS is sent to about 3.5 million households per year
-   Asks many more questions, including about income, education, language, and much more.
-   ACS data are *estimates*. The uncertainty in these estimates is expressed as *margins of error* for each variable.

::: callout-note
The ACS had a lower than usual response rate in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the smaller sample size, the margins of error are larger for 2020 data.
:::

## Geographies and variables

Census datasets are broken down into

-   Geographies
-   Variables

## Census Geographies

## Census variables

-   Different census datasets have different variables

::: incremental
-   2020 Decennial Census currently has relatively few variables (\~300)
    -   More variables will be released in the future
    -   Example: **P1_001N** = Total population
-   2016-2020 ACS has around 28,000 variables
    -   Example: **B15002_016** = Number of males with a master's degree in the population age 25 and over
