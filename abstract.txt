Obtaining, wrangling, and mapping U.S. Census data using tidycensus

The U.S. Census Bureau's mission is to serve as the nation's leading
provider of quality data about its people and economy. One way it does
this is by making data available through a set of public API's. This
talk will show how you can obtain census data through these API's,
including the American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2020 Decennial
Census, using the tidycensus package. We'll also see how tidycensus
makes it easy to obtain spatial data that you can use to draw
choropleth maps. At the end of this talk, you'll know how to download,
summarize, and map U.S. Census data for your state, your home town, or
any other region of interest.
